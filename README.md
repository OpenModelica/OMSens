# Reqs
- Linux
- Python 3 with some extra libraries. (anaconda3 includes all the dependencies)
- OpenModelica basic install (with "omc" command in path in Linux or "%OPENMODELICAHOME%\\bin\\omc" for Windows). The SystemDynamics library is included in this repo and the one included in the complete install is not needed (or used)

# Installation
## Windows
Assuming that you already have latest OpenModelica nightly installed.
NOTE: Change the paths according to your installation where ever needed in the following commands.

* 1. Install Anaconda

Note do not copy this information verbatim. 
Rather change it to adapt to your situation 

For 64-bit use https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Windows-x86_64.exe
For 32-bit use https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Windows-x86.exe

Follow the installer and install using the default options i.e., don't change anything (we recommend installing in C:\Anaconda3).

* 2. Install libpython

Open windows command prompt and type the following commands:

```
set PATH=C:\Anaconda3;C:\Anaconda3\Library\mingw-w64\bin\;C:\Anaconda3\Library\bin;C:\Anaconda3\Scripts;C:\Program Files\OpenModelica1.16.0-dev-64bit\tools\msys\mingw64\bin;%PATH%
conda install libpython
```
* 3. Compile OMSens Backend


Use the same windows command prompt from last step and run the command:

```
cd "C:\Program Files\OpenModelica1.16.0-dev-64bit\OMSens\fortran_interface"
gfortran -c Rutf.for Rut.for Curvif.for
f2py.exe -c -I. Curvif.o Rutf.o Rut.o -m curvif_simplified curvif_simplified.pyf Curvif_simplified.f90 --compiler=mingw32
"C:\Program Files\OpenModelica1.16.0-dev-64bit\bin\OMEdit.exe"
```

Now use the OMEdit we just started and run the OMSens from the menu item i.e., "Sensitivity Optimization"
